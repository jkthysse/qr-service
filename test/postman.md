# Postman

Easily integrate with Postman using the provided swagger spec exposed in the [API](http://localhost:3000/api-docs).  Use the provided [endpoint](http://localhost:3000/swagger) to import the spec from the Postman UI.

You will also find, conveniently packaged for you in this directory, the [dev environment setup](./dev.postman_environment.json) for Postman calls to use when running this API.
